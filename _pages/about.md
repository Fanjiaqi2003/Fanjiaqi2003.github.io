My name is Fan Jiaqi and I come from Rizhao, Shandong Province. I completed my undergraduate studies at Zhengzhou University, majoring in Journalism in the Experimental Class and minoring in Finance for a double degree. I served as the vice-captain of the Debate Team in the School of Journalism and won the third place in the Zhengzhou University Debate Competition. I also participated in the summer volunteer teaching program, where I was the class teacher and English teacher for the fifth grade. At China Youth Daily's campus media, I was responsible for content operation. To cater to the reading preferences of college students, I planned diversified content including online hot topics and campus life, which doubled the reading volume. In terms of hobbies, I enjoy yoga and have been practicing it consistently. This has sparked my interest in learning and promoting the healthy culture of the East. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in International Communication at Nanjing University. My research interests include but are not limited to the relationship between technology and society, and the international dissemination of Chinese traditional culture.
